# Building a Scalable AI-Powered Content Generation System: A Full-Stack Approach

## Introduction

In the age of content overload, delivering personalized, relevant, and fresh content is key. In this article, we’ll explore how a robust, scalable content generation system was built using a combination of mobile, backend, AI, and serverless technologies. The system automatically captures keywords from the user, generates AI-powered articles, and deploys them seamlessly to a live website.

## 1. Overview of the System Architecture

- **Mobile App**: Captures user-input keywords through voice.
- **Backend**: A serverless function (hosted on Vercel) processes the keywords and triggers the AI engine.
- **AI Content Generation**: Leveraging advanced AI models to create personalized articles.
- **Approval Process**: Involves a manual approval flow for content review.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Utilizes Docker, GitHub, and Cloudflare Pages for continuous deployment to a Next.js-based site.

## 2. Tech Stack Breakdown

- **Mobile App**: Built with native iOS technologies, capturing keywords using voice recognition (e.g., Speech Framework).
- **Backend**: Vercel’s serverless functions to process data, triggered by Supabase functions.
- **AI Model**: An AI-powered content generation engine capable of writing high-quality, readable articles.
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment to Cloudflare Pages, delivering static content with server-side rendering benefits via Next.js.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.
